reason to get Distinction or nearly High Disctinction
- my app is already ready to publish but still published app need more security
- using sha256
- splash screen okay
- cloud local storage both already implemnted and worked without bug for in the latest commit
- UI should be okay and simple for anyone who just want to post a quiz
- need more animation in app but because lack of resource and too many bug I must comment all of my complex animation
- code well commented and formatted
- I just want to say if good if we can use JSON File to store data not simple JSON data in the cloud that hard to retrieve and post
- UNICODE set from server based can't be done because lack of network and security and I do this using a some trick I created

That's all from me

Thanks,
Bobby
